A modern Food Recipes App
where one can browse recipes from various different kind of meal and diet types.
Application works with both #Remote and #local data sources. And for Remote data source is using a third party API for food recipes, called Spoonacular.

Also this app is able to handle no #internet connection, and store or #cache the data locally to our database when it's needed.

This app is able to search recipes from our #API directly and also
Favorites Fragment where one can save their favorite recipes for later use when they need them
